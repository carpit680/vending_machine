# vending_machine
A rather simple Raspberry Pi based Vending Machine project.

Note:

The flows.json file is for node-red interface.
The vending.py file is the main code that controls the dispensing part and the RFID scanner part.
The refill.py file is for the buttons to refill the Machine one-by-one.

Electronics components used:

RaspberryPi 3 B+
L293D x 4
LM18 RFID Reader
Geared DC motors x 8
12V SMPS
12-5 buck converter
Push buttons x 8
7-inch RPi touch display
HDMI cable
USB type B cables x 2
Power supply for Pi

	I was planning on integrating GooglePay and all but I wasnâ€™t the one to decide what was to be done with it :p. A lot can still be improved in it.
